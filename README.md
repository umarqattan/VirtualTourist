# VirtualTourist

## Description

VirtualTourist is an iOS Application that allows you to pin a location and view photos people in the area have taken. The photos are from Flickr and are persistently stored.

## User Interface

When you first open the application, you can either add a pin to the map or toggle the top right barButtonItem "Edit" to enable to remove a pin. If you want to add a pin to the map, press on a location for half a second. Afterward, a pin will drop on the map and the top left barButtonItem titled "Tour!" will become enabled. If you toggle the button, it will change from "Tour!" to "Tap a Pin!", which enables any pin on the map to be tapped. As soon as you tap a pin, you will be taken to another scene where you will be able to view the Flickr photos taken by people in the area you selected. From there, you can tap on any photo to delete it or you can generate a new set of pictures, depending on their availability.
